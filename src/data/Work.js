			"<p>Communicated proficiently with customers and co-workers to ensure no miscommunication occurred, getting customers their right order, and ensure their satisfaction in their visit. My duties well ranged from cashier, to host (which means I would open doors for customers, stock the dinning area, check up on customers periodically, and ensure their tables are cleaned). Other duties were taking drive-thru orders and drive-thru checkouts. The environment was very fast paced so communication was key to success.</p>"

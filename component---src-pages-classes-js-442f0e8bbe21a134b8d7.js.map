I learned a lot in this course. This course taught me techniques used in programming, coding styles, and the programming language C++. In addition, it helped me learn data types, structures, functions, arrays, how to run programs, how to test programs, and how to debug programs. This class was extremely influential in me as it showed what is coding and how to code. \"\r\n    },\r\n];\r\n","import styled from 'styled-components'\r\n\r\nexport const RecWrapper = styled.div`\r\n  padding: 5%;\r\n  >h1{\r\n    color: #fff;\r\n    padding-bottom: 30px;\r\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #fff;\r\n    font-weight: 300;\r\n  }\r\n  @media (max-width: 700px) {\r\n    padding: 10% 0 20%;\r\n  }\r\n`\r\nexport const RecBox = styled.div`\r\n  margin-top: 10%;\r\n  color: #eeeeee;\r\n  h3 a{\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    color: #eeeeee;\r\n    text-decoration: none;\r\n    font-weight: 300;\r\n  }\r\n  h3 a:hover{\r\n    color: #7fa1e8;\r\n  }\r\n  hr{\r\n    background: #7fa1e8;\r\n    width: 15%;\r\n    height: 3px;\r\n    margin: 3% 0;\r\n  }\r\n  >p:first-of-type{\r\n    font-size: 18px;\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    font-weight: 300;\r\n  }\r\n  >p:nth-of-type(2){\r\n    font-size: 16px;\r\n    font-weight: 300;\r\n  }\r\n`\r\nexport const RecDes = styled.p`\r\n  margin: 2% 0;\r\n  font-weight: 300;\r\n  max-width: 85%;\r\n`\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport classes from '../data/Classes'\r\nimport { RecWrapper, RecBox, RecDes } from '../styles/recStyle.js'\r\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\r\n\r\nconst Classes = () => (\r\n  <Layout>\r\n  <RecWrapper>\r\n    <h1>Classes</h1>\r\n    {\r\n      classes.map(item => (<RecBox key={item.id} >\r\n      <h3><a href={item.officialLink}>{item.name}</a></h3>\r\n          <p>Grade: {item.grade}</p>\r\n          <RecDes>{item.description}</RecDes>\r\n        <hr/>\r\n      </RecBox>\r\n      ))\r\n    }\r\n    <p style={{color: \"#FFF\"}}><b>Note: </b>Not all classes taken have been listed</p>\r\n  </RecWrapper>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Classes\r\n","const preferDefault = m => (m && m.default) || m\n\nif (process.env.BUILD_STAGE === `develop`) {\n  module.exports = preferDefault(require(`./public-page-renderer-dev`))\n} else if (process.env.BUILD_STAGE === `build-javascript`) {\n  module.exports = preferDefault(require(`./public-page-renderer-prod`))\n} else {\n  module.exports = () => null\n}\n","module.exports = \"data:image/png;base64,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\"","import React from \"react\"\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\n\nimport InternalPageRenderer from \"./page-renderer\"\nimport loader from \"./loader\"\n\nconst ProdPageRenderer = ({ location }) => {\n  const pageResources = loader.getResourcesForPathnameSync(location.pathname)\n  if (!pageResources) {\n    return null\n  }\n\n  return React.createElement(InternalPageRenderer, {\n    location,\n    pageResources,\n    ...pageResources.json,\n  })\n}\n\nProdPageRenderer.propTypes = {\n  location: PropTypes.shape({\n    pathname: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n  }).isRequired,\n}\n\nexport default ProdPageRenderer\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/blue-bg-4283e44d7dfa85772dfaaf86985c945a.png\";","import React from \"react\"\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\nimport Link, {\n  withPrefix,\n  withAssetPrefix,\n  navigate,\n  push,\n  replace,\n  navigateTo,\n  parsePath,\n} from \"gatsby-link\"\nimport PageRenderer from \"./public-page-renderer\"\n\nconst StaticQueryContext = React.createContext({})\n\nconst StaticQuery = props => (\n  <StaticQueryContext.Consumer>\n    {staticQueryData => {\n      if (\n        props.data ||\n        (staticQueryData[props.query] && staticQueryData[props.query].data)\n      ) {\n        return (props.render || props.children)(\n          props.data ?
